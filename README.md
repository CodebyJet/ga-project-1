Project 1 - Defender!

Description

This project was assigned at the end of the third week of General Assemblyâ€™s 3-month SEI (Software Engineering Immersive) course, in which I am studying the fundamentals of software engineering with the aim to launch a career in this sector. The aim of the project was to design a game from scratch within one week, working individually. I chose to build Space Invaders.

Technologies Used
To complete this project I employed JavaScript and jQuery for the functionality, HTML for the basic layout of all elements, and CSS for the styling.

Brief
With this project, we were given the brief to build a game in one week, working on our own. The game could one of six pre-chosen games. I picked Space Invaders, as it's an old school classic, and I found it to be the most engaging of the choices.

Our game had to:
Make the "Invaders" move in their classic left, down, right down repeat movement.
The Aliens and player had to shoot each other
The player was only able to move left to right.
After the week, we had to give a presentation of our game.

Planning
The first day of the project, I spent planning it out, with a rough idea of what I wanted the end result to look like, what functions I thought I would need and how I may implement them. I used excalidraw to plan the wireframe of my game
(insert picture here)

Stage 1: The Grid
With the grid, I made a 10 by 10 grid of div's within a div that held the dimensions that I was aiming for. I originally started with a grid twice the size it ended being, as I didn't like how small all the sprites looked in the end result.

Stage 2: Player Movement
I created functions to respond to the arrow keys, that kept the player along the bottom of the grid. Making sure he couldn't accidentally go off the grid.

Stage 3: Alien movement
The alien movement was created using an interval timer I called gameScaling. This pushed the aliens along the top of the grid, dropped them down and moved them in the opposite direction. I created a couple of variables to do this. A boolean that said if they should being going left or right, and a movement variable that was altered as the aliens moved along

Stage 4: Shooting
The player is able to shoot, and the aliens can shoot. I based the player being able to shoot being tied to a variable that was the distance of the grid. This stopped the player from just holding down space and getting rid of everything on the screen, and created a sense of urgency and precision with their shots.
When the shot moves into a grid with the class name of the invaders, the invader would be sliced off the array it was on, preventing accidental revival of the enemies when they moved. The hardest part of this, was fixing it so the shot didn't kill more than one alien, and that the player could shoot again when the alien died.

The alien shooting was tied to a similar variable, but instead of slicing off an array, if the players position was the same as the alien laser, then the player lost a life point, 3 strikes and it's game over.

Stage 5: Respawning aliens
The game wouldn't be much fun if it ended after one round. So I created a copy of the array the original wave was created from. Using this array, I pushed each value onto the old array, cleared the interval and started the wave off again.
This is where the gameScaling interval came in handy, after each wave of aliens, I would reduce the interval by 100 milliseconds.


Stage 6: Game Over
Now that I had implemented how the game works, I needed to create a function that ended the game, either when the aliens land, or when the player lost all his life points.
I had some problems with the aliens respawning or continuing to move and shoot after you had died. But I fixed these by changing when certain parts of the code was called.

Stage 7: Test game
I tested the game many, many times, I wanted to be sure that the base level of the game worked before I implementer any extra features or added the styling I wanted it to look like.

Stage 8: The styling
I wanted to keep an old school retro feel, but I also wanted to make this joke about the graphics costing more. Just my sense of humour.
The first thing, was the "MVP" styling, the no-graphics enabled look. This was easily done, I made the player, alien, missile and lasers different coloured blocks. Did some basic layouts of the game

The stylized actual look out to the game, is enabled through a "graphics?" button. The actual styling I wanted to keep in a lot of blues, pinks and greens, with some key text points in red.
The health points, in the graphics enabled, was 3 pictures of the old school heart containers, that pulsed as you played the game.

The title is a h1 with 2 spans inside it of the same title. With a combination of position absolute and text shadows and some basic animations. I was able to create that glitched out and fragmented look.
I created two game over screens to also go with the look

Stage 8: Bonus features.
Now that the game was styled and the basics looked how I wanted them to, I had a series of bonuses I wanted to add.
I added an animation for when you got shot, the screen would shake.
A leaderboard system that used local storage data to create and display your leader board.
I added background music, that I had found on a royalty free music site, it and all the sound affects, can be toggled on and off (Laser noises and pew-pew sound affects were added for the alien and player respectfully)

I added a Mothership style boss, she has 4 guards around her who are invincible, and you have to shoot her 3 times to win. 
Added two victory screens for when you defeat her.

I created an endless mode. In the oldschool games I grew up with, some had this secret code, that when inputted unlocked bonus features. I wanted to re-create that feel with an endless mode. When the player is asked for their name after the mothership is dead, if you type in "Endless", it will refresh the players life points and enable an endless mode, where the aliens are quicker than usual.
I added bullet collision, so when the two projectiles hit each other, both are removed.
I added a smoke "poof" effect when the player shoots, that after a set period of time, removes itself.

Future Improvements
In future iterations, I would to find a way, other than assiging different classes, to alternate or randomize the colours of the aliens. I wanted to have pink and blue aliens at the same time. I would like to add power ups, so when the player collects certain, randomly timed, objects, that they added something to how the player can interact and play.
